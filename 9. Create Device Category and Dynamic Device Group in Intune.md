4. Scope tags: Default (if none created)  
5. Click **Create** → Confirmation: *Device category successfully created*

5. After enrollment, device shows in Intune:  
   - Device Name: `Win11-CLI04`  
   - Ownership: Personal  
   - Device Category: HR Team

2. Enter details:  
   - Name: `HR Team Devices`  
   - Description: All devices from HR team  
   - Membership Type: Dynamic Device  
3. **Define Dynamic Query:**  
   - Property: `deviceCategory`  
   - Operator: `Equals`  
   - Value: `HR Team`  
   - Rule syntax example:  
     ```
     device.deviceCategory -eq "HR Team"
     ```
4. Click **Save → Create** → Confirmation: *Successfully created group*  

---

#### **5. Verify Dynamic Group Membership**
- Refresh group list → `HR Team Devices` appears  
- Dynamic rule processing may take up to **24 hours**.  
- After processing, under **Manage → Members**, the device `Win11-CLI04` appears in the group.

#### **6. Notes**
- Device category selection depends on **user accuracy**; provide guidance if needed.  
- Dynamic group automatically updates members when devices are added/removed.  
- Policies and applications can be targeted to the group.
