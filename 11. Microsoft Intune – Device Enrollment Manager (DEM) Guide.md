## Microsoft Intune – Device Enrollment Manager (DEM) Guide

### 1. **Overview of Device Enrollment Manager (DEM)**

* DEM is a **non-administrator user account** in Intune that can enroll and manage multiple devices.
* Purpose: Enroll **many devices** (bulk enrollment) without giving end users admin access.
* Capabilities:

  * A **DEM account** can enroll up to **1,000 devices**.
  * Standard user or admin accounts can enroll only **15 devices**.
  * DEM users **cannot be Intune admins**.
  * DEM accounts require an **Intune license** (e.g., Enterprise Mobility + Security E5).

**Key Difference:**

* Devices enrolled via DEM **grant admin access only to the DEM account**, not to the end user who will use the device later.

1. Log in to **Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center**: `https://endpoint.microsoft.com`
2. Go to **Devices → Enroll devices → Device Enrollment Managers**
3. Click **Add (+)** to add a new DEM.
4. Enter the **UPN** of an existing user account (must already exist in Azure AD).
5. Click **Add** → Confirmation message appears: “Successfully promoted a user.”
6. This account can now be used to enroll devices.

### 3. **Limitations of DEM Accounts**

1. **Wipe Capability**: DEM cannot wipe devices; only Intune admins can do this via Endpoint Manager.
2. **Shared Device Mode**: Windows 10/11 devices enrolled via DEM are automatically set to shared device mode.
3. **Enrollment Limit**: Maximum of **150 DEM accounts** in Intune.

### 4. **Enroll a Device Using DEM**

1. Go to a **Windows 10/11 device**.
2. Open **Settings → Accounts → Access work or school → Connect**.
3. Select **Join this device to Azure Active Directory**.
4. Enter **DEM account credentials** (e.g., `DEM@domain.com`)
5. Click **Next → Join → Done**.
6. Device now shows connected to Azure AD.

### 5. **Verify Enrollment in Intune**

1. Go back to **Microsoft Endpoint Manager → Devices → All Devices**.
2. Click **Refresh** to see the newly enrolled device.
3. Details to check:

   * Device name
   * Managed by Intune
   * Ownership: Corporate
   * Compliance status: Compliant
   * Primary user: DEM account

---

### 6. **Sign in as End User**

1. Sign out of DEM account and sign in using the **regular user account** (e.g., `User2@domain.com`).

2. End user does **not get administrator access**:

   * Settings for device management are **grayed out**
   * Cannot disconnect device from Azure AD

3. Verify local administrators:

   * DEM account is added to **built-in Administrators group**
   * End user is **not part of administrators group**

---

### ✅ Key Takeaways

* DEM accounts are ideal for **bulk provisioning** of devices.
* End users get a **managed, compliant device** without admin rights.
* Administrators maintain **control over device policies and security**.
* Always check Intune licensing for DEM accounts.

This process ensures secure, scalable enrollment while preventing unintended admin access to corporate devices.
