# Notes: Assign Intune Administrator Directory Role to an Existing User

---

## Purpose

* Assign the **Intune Administrator directory role** to an existing **Intune user account**.
* A **directory role** defines what permissions a user has within Intune and Azure AD.

---

## Key Concepts

* **Directory Roles:** Define sets of permissions for users.
* Two types of roles:

  * **Built-in roles** – Predefined roles for common Intune scenarios.
  * **Custom roles** – Created by admins with specific permissions as needed.
* Can assign roles using:

  * **Azure Active Directory Admin Center**
  * **Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center**

---

## Scenario

* Assign the **Intune Administrator** role to user: **Test User1**.

---

## Steps to Assign Intune Administrator Role

### 1. Access Endpoint Manager

  **[https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)**
